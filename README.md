## Prerequisites

Ensure you have an Ubuntu system (tested on Ubuntu 22.04) and basic familiarity with the terminal.

## Step 1: Running the Libra Validator and VFN

1. Firewall setting for Mainnet Validator

```bash
sudo ufw allow 6180; sudo ufw allow 6181; sudo ufw allow 3000; 
```

2. Firewall setting for Mainnet VFN (A machine other than the one where the Validator is installed)

```bash
sudo ufw allow 6180; sudo ufw allow 6182; sudo ufw allow 8080; 
```
	
3. Download and Run the Mainnet Setup Script

```bash
apt update && apt install nano && apt install wget
wget -O ~/0l_mainnet_setup.sh https://github.com/AlanYoon71/OpenLibra_Mainnet/raw/main/0l_mainnet_setup.sh \
&& chmod +x ~/0l_mainnet_setup.sh && ./0l_mainnet_setup.sh
```

4. Running the Libra Validator (VFN)

```bash
apt update && apt install tmux -y
tmux new -s node
libra node
```

If you want to detach from the tmux session you created, press Ctrl+b and then d.
To attach to that session again, run `tmux attach -t node`.

## Step 2: Check Syncing and Voting status

```bash
echo ""; curl -s localhost:9101/metrics | grep diem_state_sync_version{; \
echo -e "\nVote Progress:"; cat ~/.libra/data/secure-data.json | jq .safety_data.value.last_voted_round
```

If the sync and vote counts keep increasing, your node is running successfully.

To monitor the node status more deeply in real-time, I recommend installing Prometheus + Grafana.
There are already easy and excellent installation tutorials available, so refer to them.

If you have already installed Prometheus and Grafana on your Validator, don't forget to open port 3000.
   
Note: 
If you are participating in the Mainnet as a first-time post-genesis Validator, 
don't forget to check the onboarding process and register using `libra txs validator register`.

Carpe Diem, Carpe Libra!âœŠðŸ”†
